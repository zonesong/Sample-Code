Here are some demo of MATLAB code I wrote. They are mainly some machine learning algorithms I used in my research work.

Functions: Affinity.m, ALNDA.m, centralization.m, cross_validation.m, data_division.m, distance.m, KNN.m, LDA.m, new_1.m, normalization.m, TMSD_figure.m, TMSD_gen.m
Main programs: main_new.m, main_test.m, PCOG_main.m
Dataset: all of the .mat files
